# android-crypto (Release 1.0.0)
This project contains encryption utils used for assymetric cryptography. This project is used in two key areas:

1. Blockchain (sawtooth): Sawtooth utility provides Public key infrastructure (PKI) which is the critical component of blockchain architecture.
2. Client authentication for RESTful services using Jason Web Tokens (JWT). Header tokens are used to consistently validate user during a session's lifetime. These tokens are also used to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.
